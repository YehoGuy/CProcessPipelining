"ls -l | tail -n 2".
question A : what does "ls -l" do, what does "tail -n 2" do, and what should their combination produce?
answer: ls -l generates a detailed information on each of the files and folders in the current directory, 
        such as permissions, Owner name, file size, last modified etc...
        trail -n <num> outputs only the last <num> lines of an input.
        so the combination ls -l | tail -n 2 will output detailed information of the 
        last 2 files in alphanumeric order in the current-directory.
